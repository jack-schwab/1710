# Endangered Species Trading in Africa Final Project

Welcome to our final project on endangered species trading in Africa! To run this project, download the zip file, and simply run the index.html file. From there, you can scroll through our visualization story. The instructions on how to interact with the story are all included in the webpage and pretty straightforward, so you should be able to get a good sense of how to interact with each visualization and how each visualization interacts with each other one. We hope you enjoy our project and learn a lot from it!
